# My very first web page
Welcome to my test-site README.md page

## Project Description
This project is a basic three page website. Page one (index) displays logos of various technologies with a link to each one underneath.  All pages are linked to a CSS file and on Page One, I have styled the text, the top menu and the image headings.
Page Two has various types of form to fill in. Page Three has a field-box, various headings & divs and a footer.  I also embedded a span style in the heading to change the appearance of the word "article" in the paragraph section.

In this test-site, I am practising how to create and edit files in my workspace on Cloud 9 using HTML and CSS. I have created a Git repository to store my files and send them to my Github account. From my Github account, assessors can view my work and even click on a link to a live version of my test-site.

### Technologies used
I have used various technologies in this project. I have created HTML files and linked them to a CSS file.  The styles declared in the css file gives my output a more interesting look. The Divs I created in my html files are styled and positioned thanks to my linked css file.

I then create a Git repository and add all my files to it. This repository keeps all my files together and allows me to view and edit them before sending them to my Github account.  My Github account serves as a back-up of all my project files. It also allows others to view my code and click on a live version of my project.
I Know my files are safe in Github.

I have validated my HTML files in the W3C HTML validator and also my CSS files in the W3C CSS validator.
